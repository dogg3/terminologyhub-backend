## Problem

In product development, different departments often use inconsistent terminology, leading to confusion, delays, and unnecessary rework. For example, a term like "user" might be called "player" by designers or "participant" by marketers, causing friction during the development process.

### Example
At a gaming company, these misalignments occur frequently:
- **Conflicting terms** like "game format" vs "game mode" or "rank" vs "position" lead to confusion.
- Meetings are spent clarifying terms, which leads to wasted time and potential errors in development.

### How Often Does It Happen?
This occurs on a weekly basis, impacting almost every project phaseâ€”from planning to deployment.
